Appraisal variables are defined as criteria along which the significance of events can be judged, as they relate to one's beliefs, intentions and desires. These judgments are entirely subjective to the person interpreting them and are based on their relationship with their environment (so it may be very different from other people's perspective). Remember that the events/situations in focus also include what the counselor is saying and the current relationship dynamics between the counselor and the patient.

            "Step 2. use a process called \"appraisal\", which is based on appraisal-based theories of emotion, including Lazarus's theory, to identify various dimensions of your interpretation of the situation that will impact the emotion you will feel. To take this step, you should bring to mind the Patient Persona, the beliefs, desires and intentions the patient had, and think about their relationship with the situation. Then based on your interpretation of that relationship, answer the following questions as a numerical score from among these choices {0: very small,  1: fairly small,  2: small,  3: large,  4: fairly large,  5: very large} and put your choice as an integer in the output argument \"appraisal_variables\" within the final JSON. For each appraisal variable, the definition and guide on how to score it is given in <>. When answering these questions, you should put yourself in the patient's shoes :\n" +

            "\"Relevance\": <Relevance measures the significance of an event for the agent. Here we can equate significance with utility. An event outcome is only deemed significant if it facilitates or inhibits a state predicate with non-zero utility. My judgments about this situation are as follows: given the beliefs, desires and intentions I had, the overall significance and impact of this situation on me is... >,\n" +
            "\"Desirability\": <Desirability captures the appraised valence of an event with regard to an agent’s preferences. An event is desirable, from some agent’s perspective, if it facilitates a state to which the agent attributes positive utility or if it inhibits a state with negative utility. An event is undesirable if it facilitates a state with negative utility or if it inhibits a state with positive utility. My judgments about this situation are as follows: in relation to the beliefs, desires and intentions I had, the overall desirability of this situation for me is...>,\n" +
            "\"Expectedness\": <Expectedness is the extent to which the truth value of a state could have been predicted from the causal interpretation. My judgments about this situation are as follows: based on my previous interpretations of everything that happened, the overall expectedness or predictability of this situation is....>,\n" +
            "\"Likelihood\": <Likelihood characterizes the certainty of the event. Is it something that definitely happened or definitely will happen, or is it something that may have or might occur.  My judgments about this situation are as follows: given the beliefs, desires and intentions I had, the likelihood of this situation being the case is...>,\n" +
            "\"Controllability\": <Controllability is associated with an agent’s ability to cope (in a problem-focused way) with appraised events. Controllability is a measure of an agent’s potential to actively reverse negative, maintain positive circumstances. My judgments about this situation are as follows: given the beliefs, desires and intentions I had, the chances that I can influence this situation for the better are...>,\n" +
            "\"Changeability\": <Changeability is also associated with an agent’s ability to cope (in a problem-focused way) with appraised events. Changeability is a measure of how likely an appraised event will change without direct intervention by some agent. Here, this corresponds to the likelihood that the event will change by some factor other than direct action by the agent from whose perspective the frame is being assessed. For example, a looming threat may be appraised as changeable if the effect of the threatening action is uncertain or if some intervening act not under control of the agent might occur. My judgments about this situation are as follows: given the beliefs, the chances of this situation taking a turn for the better without effort on my part are....>,\n" +
            "\"Causal attribution\": <Causal attribution characterizes whether the causal agent behind an event deserves credit or blame. In general, the problem of attributing credit or blame involves a number of considerations: Who caused the outcome? Did they foresee the consequence? Was it intended? Were they coerced? The attribution score should account for all of these factors. Here, causal attribution is assigned to whatever agent actually executed the action in question (for example if one's mom is the person behind an event, the credit/blame for that event is attributed to their mom). My judgments about this situation are as follows: me or someone else is to blame for this situation....>\n" +

            "Step 3. Based on the appraisal answers you have generated and the Patient Persona, score the level of Pleasure (Valance/Evaluation) Arousal (Activity), and Dominance (Potency) according to Mehrabial et al.'s Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) model of affect. These variables can be positive and negative, so you should score them by choosing a real value from -1 to 1, with one significant digit. The Pleasure-Displeasure Scale measures how pleasant or unpleasant one feels about something. For instance, both anger and fear are unpleasant emotions, and both score on the displeasure side. However, joy is a pleasant emotion. The Arousal-Nonarousal Scale measures how energized or soporific one feels. It is not the intensity of the emotion -- for grief and depression can be low arousal intense feelings. While both anger and rage are unpleasant emotions, rage has a higher intensity or a higher arousal state. However boredom, which is also an unpleasant state, has a low arousal value. The Dominance-Submissiveness Scale represents the controlling and dominant versus controlled or submissive one feels, and represents the amount of influence you feel (an aspect of) the environment has upon you and vice versa. For instance, while both fear and anger are unpleasant emotions, anger is a dominant emotion, while fear is a submissive emotion. Put these three scores in the final JSON as the following dictionary keys:\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Step 5. Coping with an emotion determines how one responds to the appraised significance of the event. Coping relies on appraisal to identify significant features of the person–environment relationship and to assess the potential to maintain or overturn these features, also called coping potential. Given the interpreted appraisal and the emotions, what is the coping potential of these emotions? First reason about this and put that into \"coping_potential_reasoning\". Then, put the level of potential as a numerical score from among these choices {0: very small,  1: fairly small,  2: small,  3: large,  4: fairly large,  5: very large}, in the argument \"coping_potential\".\n" +

Based on the inferred emotion (whether it is a positive or negative emotion) and the Patient Persona, think about the most likely coping approach for this patient (put your reasoning in the \"coping_approach_reasoning\" argument), then choose one or two approaches from among the following. Coping strategies essentially work in the reverse direction of the appraisal that motivates them, by identifying features of the causal interpretation (the person-environment relationship) that produced the appraisal and that should be maintained or altered (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions and expectations). So, coping behaviors are meant to make changes in the beliefs, desires, and intentions to make it easier to deal with the emotions. Coping behaviors are divided into two broad categories. Problem-focused coping means acting on the environment to change the situation or its impact, while emotion-focused coping works by altering one’s interpretation of circumstances, for example, by discounting a potential threat or abandoning a cherished goal. As a rule of thumb, the chosen type of coping (problem- vs. emotion-focused) depends on the coping potential of the situation.
